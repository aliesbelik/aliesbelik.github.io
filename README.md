# aliesbelik.github.io

Here is the code behind [my website](aliesbelik.github.io) made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Website uses [Jekyll-Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) theme - a minimal, responsive theme, inspired by the [Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) theme for Ghost and thoroughly crafted by [Josh Gerdes][josh-gerdes] for Jekyll.
